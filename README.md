Simple Interest Calculator
Welcome to the Simple Interest Calculator! This tool calculates simple interest, a fundamental concept in finance. This project was initiated by [Your Company Name] as part of our mission to empower and provide opportunities to low-income individuals.

Introduction
Simple interest is a quick method to calculate the interest charge on a loan. It's determined by multiplying the daily interest rate by the principal by the number of days that elapse between payments.

Usage
bash
Copy code
./simple-interest.sh <principal> <rate> <time>
Where:

<principal> is the initial amount of money that was deposited or loaned.
<rate> is the rate of interest per period.
<time> is the time the money is deposited or borrowed for, in years.
Example
bash
Copy code
./simple-interest.sh 1000 5 2
This will calculate the simple interest for a principal amount of 1000 units, an interest rate of 5%, over 2 years.
